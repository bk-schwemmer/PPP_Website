# PPP Website
This school project was for a UI Design class. 
The purpose of the project was to create an interactive desktop prototype of the redeveloped website according to the design specifications provided 
by a fictitious company, Paradigm Pet Professionals.

A poorly designed static website was provided as PPP's current site and I was tasked with redesigning it to align with their new specifications and 
rebranding requirements. The project was written in HTML and uses CSS to provide styling of the pages. It is meant to showcase UI Design skills and 
HTML/CSS proficiency.
